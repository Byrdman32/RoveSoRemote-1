# RoveSoRemote

This is a WIP flutter 2.0 app that uses the RoveComm message protocol to communicate with the Rover.

Todo:

- RoveComm sending
- All of RoveComm TCP
- Using the Manifest
- Sending Lighting Commands
- Using the Autonomy system to create a pseudo "Tesla summon" feature that allows the rover to drive behind you
