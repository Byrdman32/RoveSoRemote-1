# RoveSoRemote

![Screenshot](/images/lighting.png)
This is a WIP flutter 2.0 app that uses the RoveComm message protocol to communicate with the Rover.

Todo:

- All of RoveComm TCP
- Using the Manifest
- Using the Autonomy system to create a pseudo "Tesla summon" feature that allows the rover to drive behind you
